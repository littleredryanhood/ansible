#Ansible Minecraft Project


##An Ansible playbook that deploys the latest minecraft java server


This project was intended to help me get better with using ansible and terraform.  This project is prett basic but will have some additional improvements in future updates.


Planned improvements

        * Install minecraft exporter for collecting minecraft metrics with prometheus.
        * Include server.properties to customize MC world
        * Improve code readability so it looks like I actually know what I'm doing.
